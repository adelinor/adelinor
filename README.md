- 👋 Hi, I’m @adelinor
- 👀 I’m interested in resilient systems and I'm in love with quality initiatives that allow developers to focus on delivering functional requirements. Examples are the Spring Framework and Angular .
- 🌱 I’m currently learning at how the two phase commit approach can be substituted in asynchronous systems.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on delivering quality items with my colleagues :)
- 📫 How to reach me: here.
